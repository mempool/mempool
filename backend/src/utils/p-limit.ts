/*
How it works:
`this._head` is an instance of `Node` which keeps track of its current value and nests
another instance of `Node` that keeps the value that comes after it. When a value is
provided to `.enqueue()`, the code needs to iterate through `this._head`, going deeper
and deeper to find the last value. However, iterating through every single item is slow.
This problem is solved by saving a reference to the last value as `this._tail` so that
it can reference it to add a new value.
